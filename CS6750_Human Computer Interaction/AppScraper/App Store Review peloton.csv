The  apple store manager said that the iwatch I had could not be updated any longer when apple rolled out updates because it was to old and this could have been causing the issues with the peloton app.  Since I upgraded my watch and bought a new phone everything has been working.  So I am not sure it was the peloton app that was not working properly or the fact that apple was again making it so old phones and watches were not working with some apps so I am changing my rating to better reflect my experience. 

The app still crashes with outdoor workouts sometimes right away sometimes in the middle of the run or walk. This is frustrating and a waste of time having to stop and restart from the beginning. How can a company this big not have an IT team that can fix this! The metrics for the running and walking program for when you walk inside that synced with the watch used to calculate distance nope not anymore! Please fix this and no I don‚Äôt need to contact you again I‚Äôve done it serval times and all the troubleshooting you all had me do did not fix the issue. Frustrating when you are tying to keep track of your milage. Please Fix this. Your last update didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ugh use to be a great app.",True

However I really only use that to monitor a heart rate in my sleep quality and a half and other other things I don‚Äôt use it for the work out because the workouts on that app just didn‚Äôt interest me for some reason I guess is the best way to say it. However I‚Äôve worked outA couple what time is very regularly using this peloton app the workouts are fun, they‚Äôre just the right difficulty, and I think it‚Äôs a little clearer to follow because it‚Äôs really just in the videos just the instructor. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre in a whole class which I kind of found distracting with the other app so you feel that it‚Äôs just you and the instructor with one on one which is really great. The boxing workouts that I‚Äôve done are excellent and they make you sweat. I just finished an ab workout that was only five minutes and it was it was very very difficult but that‚Äôs great because that‚Äôs something that I want to work on. Overall I got to say it‚Äôs a great app you‚Äôre gonna love it you‚Äôre going to get some great workouts in you‚Äôre going to continuously use it as I will. My one why would the app I guess is sometimes the music is a little bit distracting because I think it‚Äôs just a little bit too loud but I I think there‚Äôs a way to mediate that. I also just meditated using this app and the meditations are nice the calming perfect so all in all it‚Äôs a really really good app that I think you will get your moneys worth out of",False
2,Vast improvement from original app,,loanflyer,2020-04-04 15:47:12,5,"Below is my rating from when the app first appeared a few years ago. It wasn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs now amazing. I use Chromecast to take it with me on the road and in my condo‚Äôs gym. Great, great workouts. 

Old review:
I guess the utility of the app depends upon your goals. If your goal is heart rate training (HRT), or some sort of high intensity fitness training, there are better videos on You Tube. If your goal is to pass the time with a certain type of music, and get ""life coaching"" from a yoga teacher, then this app will work for you. I found Steve Little to be the best, most serious instructor. I found Nicole Meline to be one I wanted to mute as she offered empty platitudes like ""make yourself essential"", ""paint a new masterpiece today"", ""you don't have to accept that inheritance"". Huh? I'm looking to work hard and get my heart rate up to 90-93% That isn't a goal of this program. Apparently, helping the depressed is. What they need to do to cater to serious fitness folks: get some graphics on the screen: heart rate as a percent of maximum; cadence; resistance,; effort level; segment time; total time. Instead, you're gonna get ""favorite playlists"". That's fine for the Lululemon yoga pants in the grocery store ""athlete"", but how about something for the serious folks? They clearly have the technology. For me, it's back to You Tube videos.  I'll check back in six months. Maybe they'll come around.",False
3,Love this app!,,URMomFromCollege,2020-05-29 18:27:18,5,"I have been a Peloton bike user (in my building gym) for a year and a half.  I was doing workouts 5 days/wk. When the COVID-19 crisis started unfolding. As many things started changing the directive to close gyms came to fruition & my building complied and closed our gym facilities. 
I knew I‚Äôd be able to ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with the changes put into place however, one thing that really annoyed me was that I‚Äôd have to stop my 5 day a week habit that I have painstakinly made part of my daily week day regimen.  I did not want to break this habit. 
This is where this app came in!  Peloton brilliantly extended a 90 day trial for their app. I am hooked!  I plan on keeping my membership and plan to incorporate it into my routine. I have been able to keep up with workouts from the same people who I have grown to love and more.  While, its not the cycling part I was able to seamelssly continue a workout routine.  Once things start to reopen I will go back to cycling but I definitely will want the other workouts that were not currenty part of using the gym bike. 
I love the variety of workouts, instrutors, playlists...one thing I would love to see is an ability to create a workout ‚Äúplaylist‚Äù. Sometimes I want to exercise for 60 minutes total and  I like to do 2 30 minute workouts. I would love the ability to select the 2 workouts and have them play in selected order.",False
4,Subscription fitness at its best!,,Minter81,2018-10-28 00:23:47,5,"Been using the app for workouts for the last 4 months and I am obsessed with it. Am particularly keen on the treadmill workouts - I love running outdoors but it‚Äôs not always practical and boy does this app take away from the monotony of treadmill running. It even spurred me on to my faster 5k, 10k and 1 mile distances for the last 3 years in the short time I have been using it. I love the ranges provided so you can measure profession by taking the same class, the instructors are inspiring, the user experience is sleek and uncomplicated. I too would love to be able to interact with my contacts a bit more (get notifications of them finishing workouts etc.) and see if they signed up for the same live classes - there is a sense of community already but I think it could be built on. As an app user, I‚Äôd love the ability to rate the workouts after I complete them to more easily return to the ones I enjoyed most. Personally a bit more information on the run itself would be useful I.e 4 min work up, followed by 3 min sprint intervals followed by 3 mins hill intervals etc. But these are minor points - I have already converted 5+ friends to the app and am thinking of getting the treadmill itself because I love the whole idea so much! #teampeloton",False
5,Exercise addict,,ChaceCee,2019-07-20 00:51:48,5,"My orthopedic surgeon told me I was a classic exercise addict when I was sitting in his office a few years ago for my 3rd knee surgery in as many years. I was a mixed martial artist, a CrossFitter and an all around glutton for punishment when it came to the way I treated my body.
If it didn‚Äôt hurt, I wasn‚Äôt interested. My husband told me to look at Peloton but I was never interested in cycling because it didn‚Äôt seem intense enough. Well... after much coaxing, I bought a Peloton and I freaking loved it from the minute I started. Totally surprised myself. The other thing I didn‚Äôt count on was the community. Similar to what I was used to in CrossFit and in fighting. Peloton has built a wonderful platform that everyone feels welcome. I also didn‚Äôt count on the amazing content that this app has. It‚Äôs not just about the bike or the tread. It‚Äôs about workouts I can do when I travel for work. Everything from strength workouts to outdoor running to yoga and meditation. It‚Äôs worth every penny. And the instructors... I realize none of them know me, but they are a big part of my life. They are knowledgeable and vulnerable and real and inspiring on so many levels.

While I appreciate that they warn you if the video is explicit it doesn‚Äôt help when they‚Äôre almost ALL explicit with no way to filter out the bad language. I‚Äôd like the instructors to buy a thesaurus and use cleaner language. Never heard so much swearing by instructors in any fitness app I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs the only reason I probably won‚Äôt be purchasing after free trial ends. The video editors could bleep out some of the bad words but don‚Äôt seem to care. If you have kids then les mills tv app is superior. They too offer cycling workout videos. The peloton workouts are good but I have to watch them on silent with subtitles when my young child is awake and play my own music. The frequent swearing ruins this otherwise great app. My other gripe is the lack of a pause button. Les mills has it so why not add it to peloton videos? All our kids are home due to the pandemic and not being able to pause it when they enter the room is a huge problem. These are not family friendly workouts which is too bad since son no longer gets PE in school. If you‚Äôd remove all the swearing kids could use them for home PE purposes with us. I haven‚Äôt tried the live classes in app yet but am assuming they have swearing too.,False

First, I like to plan out my next ride on the app when I‚Äôm commuting or in between meetings. (I always do on demand rides because of my work schedule). I really really need to see the playlist on the app because music is an important part of a ride. Second, I‚Äôd also like to see my achievement badges on the app. Third, it would be great to see side by side comparisons of output/cadence/resistance with connections who have completed the same ride. Fourth, it would be interesting to think about sending push notifications when your connections finish a ride - I love giving my friends kudos when they complete rings on the Apple Watch. This totally helps build community.  Finally, I‚Äôd really like functionality to be able to search for theme rides (ie Madonna, Lady Gaga etc). They‚Äôre a pain to search for now because you have to rely on comments on the Facebook page and then search for a specific date and instructor.

My only gripe is that once you start a program, it gives a set amount of days to finish the program. So if you get sick, or if anything else comes up that takes you out of the game for more than a day (and I type this as I‚Äôm feeling I‚Äôll and knowing I won‚Äôt be up for working out for at least a few days), you‚Äôre out of luck, and those classes just get skipped. Even if you do them later, it doesn‚Äôt count. And if you‚Äôre doing a program that‚Äôs more than just two to three days a week, you‚Äôll never catch up. Anyway, I‚Äôm a big fan of programs. I‚Äôm not an athlete, I‚Äôm not a trainer, so I like to have someone tell me what to do and when, but I really wish this app allowed for some life to get in. Alternatively, my preference would be to not timebox programs at all. Nike doesn‚Äôt, why does peloton need to?

9,Breathe new life into your workouts !,,goldilocksrocks,2019-08-08 05:19:14,5,"Wow! I am enamored with this app. The classes are quick, Engaging  and have immediate results. I‚Äôve never been a big gym rat and prefer to be outside during all seasons. I have been running fun runs with peloton and I‚Äôm excited every day to get out and meet a new instructor and even hear different music. Every class I have taken the instructors are precise in body positioning which prevents injuries and also makes what you are trying to do easier and of course Beneficial. It is so easy to come out of form and then often the exercise you are working so hard to do is loosing its power !  So far I have found  wonderfully inspiring teachers who you know are one hundred percent genuine and legit in their own personal lives. I have been into fitness for many years but this is different than anything I‚Äôve done , it is encouraging, tough but gentle and spot on accurate when targeting areas of the body to tone and strengthen. 
I‚Äôm so excited to be part of the peloton family. My abs have never looked and FELT so good ! Being able to be anywhere and do a ten minute or hour long class leave you with no excuses !

10,Duplicate Subscription fraud,,Jnschin,2020-09-22 18:32:16,2,"BOO on Peloton!!! Warning - If you get this app to use while you are waiting for delivery of your bike/tread, beware to cancel your trial subscription when you start your full subscription at delivery/installation time. Even though my family members linked their App to our bike membership before the end of the trial period, Peloton continued to collect money from us for multiple individual subscriptions. This is managed through the Apple or Google pay systems - search for ‚ÄúHow to Cancel a Peloton digital membership‚Äù on Peloton support site. Peloton denies all responsibility for the duplicate subscription and forces you to talk with Apple/Google to resolve this. They do not care about your satisfaction or inconvenience even though they develop the Apps and so control the membership behaviors, and must receive a significant fraction of the collected funds. I spoke with several Peloton support people and while pleasant, they showed zero flexibility to help a customer and were very firm in just stonewalling people who have paid a lot of $$ for their equipment and content.

I am much less satisfied as a customer because of this small glitch - entirely because Peloton is handling this so callously.

I am sure that some class action lawyers will make solid $ from bringing suit to correct this lousy App behavior and Peloton‚Äôs abandonment of their customers.",False
11,Love my bike but HATE the Apple TV app,,Zach F.,2020-07-28 23:56:58,3,"I‚Äôve had my Peloton bike for a little over a month now and it‚Äôs definitely changed my relationship with working out and it‚Äôs something I genuinely look forward to using. Plus the Peloton platform has tons of different types of workouts (strength, yoga, boot camp, walking/running, etc) you can follow to get some variety into your exercise routine. The iPhone and iPad apps make it easy to take advantage to the huge library of workout content available on the platform both live and on demand. The Apple TV app on the other hand is lacking some significant features that make it much, much less useful. First off you cannot join live classes on the Apple TV app not can you even see the schedule, second you cannot see any of the collections or recommended programs they‚Äôve curated which are numerous and very well through out, and finally you can‚Äôt see anything having to do with your profile and workout history. It‚Äôs lacking a good 40+% of the functions the other apps include. You can basically only see the on demand classes for each category and filter from there. I hope a significant update is planned to bring it in line as it‚Äôs easier now to just AirPlay from your iPhone or iPad. Get it together Peloton!!",False
12,Best thing I've done for myself in a long time,,QR scanerless,2019-03-30 22:05:38,5,"I've had the app now for a little over a year, and this has been the most I've worked out consistently in a couple of decades. I had belonged to an expensive gym, and the only classes I really wanted to go to were the spin classes, but I hated going to spin class. Trying to get there on time to get a bike, and dealing with a room full of smelly people, me included, plus not always understanding what the instructor was saying made me not like it so much. I quit the gym, bought a spin type bike, with attachments for my iPad, cadence monitor, heart rate monitor, spd clip pedals, and I haven't stopped getting on the bike. The instructors are great. I figured out which ones suit me best after a few months, the music is great, and I can hear and understand the instructions perfectly. I have a little table next to my bike to keep my hand weights and extra water. I love this so much. I've lost fat and have developed muscle tone. There's been a recent update where I can attach my cadence and heart rate monitors to the Peloton app which is fantastic. Thank you for that.

I don‚Äôt have any peloton equipment, yet I still have a huge variety of classes to choose from. It‚Äôs addictive. I recommend it to all my friends and family, despite its fallbacks.

I can only give it 4 stars because the app still needs a lot of improvement. I prefer to cast my workouts to the tv, but it has terrible compatibility with Google Chromecast. I‚Äôll try to cast, then if I even just wake my phone to look at the lock screen, it‚Äôll lose the play position. The audio will be mismatched with the video. Today it even was playing the same video out of both the tv and my phone at different times in the video. Additionally the UX isn‚Äôt very intuitive; it took me a while to get used to finding things in the app, and they‚Äôre different than where they are on the desktop. It needs simplification. Once these downfalls are addressed, I‚Äôll be able to give it 5 stars. But for now I still love the app, though I just have a slightly frustrated experience.",False

The only things that would make it better would be some minor additions for us app only users. 1- as of now to see who high fives or to give a high 5 the user has to change the phone orientation from landscape to portrait. This is very difficult to do while huffing and puffing and trying not to die lol. It would be great if they could make the notification a banner instead of that red dot. The banner could extend out across the bottom showing then name of the person giving the high five and then we could tap on it and high five back in the banner without having to reorient the phone. And 2- if they could make it possible to get distance to appear in the run summary like cadence does at the end on the bike. Allow some kind of blue tooth compatibility for runs like the wahoo sensor Is for the bike‚Äîmaybe through a foot pod‚Äîso we app users can see the miles we put in and can maybe participate in some run challenges.

The variety of classes, quality of instruction, plethora of class options, and, yes, the badges have kept me a reliable user for months - and I used to *hate* trying to get up in the morning to exercise! I particularly love the new barre classes and hope for more soon?

My only/major complaint, and reason for one star off, is that live classes have gotten very unreliable with lots of skipping. This makes it really hard to track intervals, which is the core of so many of the cycling classes - you‚Äôll be starting a 20 second speed interval and then 4 seconds later the instructor‚Äôs suddenly back to a steady pace... and just when you‚Äôve figured out whether you skipped forward or backward, they‚Äôre on to something different and you missed it entirely.

16,Ok with drawbacks,,Tsmoments,2021-04-03 23:11:48,5,"For the most part, I really enjoy the app but ... More as feedback to Peloton
1. They ignore a large market - not everyone is their 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs or 40‚Äôs. There are very fit people in their 50‚Äôs, 60‚Äôs, 70‚Äôs and even 80‚Äôs who would love the app but the music selection is slim pickings. 
2. If you like country music, class selection is slim pickings. 
3. If you travel a lot and are off the grid, forget taking classes with you. Such a bummer. Other subscription services let you download your music, classes or videos and enjoy off the grid so long as you are paying a monthly service fee. This for me is the deal breaker. I am without any form of WiFi or cellular connection often and cannot understand why I cannot take my classes with me if I am paying for them. 
4. The yoga classes that I have taken thus far are just so so. It is about breath and movement but the instructors just talk too much. It isn‚Äôt instruction but empty platitudes. Focus on the yoga. I know some people need to hear their name called out and a hardy pat on the back, but in the middle of a yoga class is just not the time.",False

I am getting back to working out after a very long break and this app has not only made it possible, it has made it fun. I am trying things I would never try at the gym- I completed Robyn‚Äôs Tabata challenge and am working my way through the Andy‚Äôs strength program.

This always happens on my second workout when I am stacking. As soon as I dismiss that message the HR monitor starts working again. Then, once my watch screen turns off the connection is lost again. I have discovered closing the app and restarting it seems to resolve the issue until I get to the second workout with the app open.

Update - 8/7/21

Integration with my Apple watch is broken again.  Peleton says it cannot find my watch when my watch is clearly paired with my phone and other app work fine.  It is apparent that Peleton does not do proper testing to verify functions or they just do not care about devices other than their own.",True

The Peloton app has been a game changer for me.  After just 2 weeks, I can run for 25 min straight (I probably couldn‚Äôt even do that in high school).  The app is so easy to use.  I usually do the elliptical at the gym because it doesn‚Äôt hurt my brain as much and I‚Äôve used the Outdoor (audio only) and videos to guide me.  The structure of each video is so great!  I used to be a clock watcher on the boring machine, but with the app it‚Äôs about getting through small parts of the without.  The trainers are so personable and walk me through the whole thing.

Today, the audio of the workout played on my phone while I streamed on the tv. Never happened before. It‚Äôs just getting worse and worse. These auto responses from the developer are waste of time as no on responses.

I absolutely love the Peloton content. However, the app is syncing with the Apple watch less & less these days, even with everything up to date. The odd thing is that sometimes it syncs up enough to turn show my heart rate, the workout time, etc. on the watch but not on the app itself so the output is incorrect. I often have to start & restart my watch, phone, and/or workout to get them to sync. It‚Äôs very disruptive when getting set up to workout. I hope it returns to normal.",True

The instructors are skilled, fit, encouraging, and  effective, and while some age-related limitations often require me to make adjustments in their routines, by the end I‚Äôve had a terrific workout. Having a library of workouts allows me to exercise when I want, and the variety allows me to vary the intensity as any day warrants.

So I called customer services, who then called the dispatch in my area and they claimed I was rescheduled do to pandemic issues. This excuse is unacceptable to me.

Music can be filtered by a broad category but there isn‚Äôt anyway to search a specific artist and see what classes they‚Äôre featured in. I believe these are functions if you own the actual bike or treadmill but it would be amazing to have this as a separate app feature. I‚Äôd also love to have an option to queue up my work outs so I can smoothly transition from warm up to workout to cool down without having to go back to the menu and find what I‚Äôm looking for to continue my workout.",False

January 2021: I love the app and the workouts but the app for the Apple Watch is awful. It used to work fine but I feel like since the most recent peloton iPhone app update my heart rate stops recording once my watch screen goes to sleep/turns off so I have to raise my watch or tap on it to wake it back up so it can record my heart rate as I‚Äôm working out. I don‚Äôt have this problem with the normal activity app on the Apple Watch so this is definitely a peloton issue. The running metrics also stop recording too so it‚Äôll say I ran half as long as I actually did.",False

73,A few annoyances,,I Smell Awesome,2021-11-16 00:15:02,3,"I like the bike a lot.  The classes are alright,  I have a few instructors that I love.  They offer a lot of classes and it‚Äôs crazy convenient when you have zero time.  The bike is 5 stars and the quantity and variety of classes is 5 stars.  This platform is 3.  When they add new classes there is a banner on the main screen bike and monitor, you can‚Äôt go around it.  The literally force you to click on it to move forward and that takes you to where they inositol you go.  I don‚Äôt care for that.  Thanks for adding new classes, I‚Äôll look at them should I choose to do so.  
      The class I took tonight was great, the instructor dropped a colorful word. Maybe it was by accident or maybe he just doesn‚Äôt care.

I really appreciate when the instructors stay focused on the task at hand. A few days ago a strength instructor told us about his favorite football team losing its first string quarterback but replacement was doing well for second string and a minor bowl game. It was bizarre and distracting. 
I also appreciate when the intensity of the music matches the intensity of the work out. The mismatching is sometimes awkward. I also appreciate some form of beat but not all instructor music has that. 
Maybe I‚Äôm just being old-fashioned and certainly I‚Äôm not very hip, but so far everything seems geared toward 25 to 40-year-old people. Finally, I will say the instruction and the exercises chosen are excellent and the variety of choices for time and classes are amazing. Chrisgay",False

Lots of variety in classes and instructors, so far I‚Äôve enjoyed the whole experience.
I couple of points... would Really appreciate the removal of the n-word in the rap music - as a 60 year old African American, it‚Äôs just not what I want to hear as I power walk (nothing against rap, just would be better to use the clean versions of songs) not everyone using app is 20!!!
Would love to see some longer distances in run, walk and bike, instruction on training for races, etc. 
lastly, would love to see bpm classes. Would love to have the music really match the speed.
So far, I feel like the instructors are keeping me motivated to move faster, but the music just doesn‚Äôt inspire because the bpm are slower than the actual movement speed.

You can select your workout (running, cycling, outdoor running, yoga, meditation, weights, etc) and the best part is you can filter from their library of options easily. You can select duration, specific instructors and music genre. You can use this app on any equipment. That‚Äôs how I started. I would walk up to our HOA gym and get in a high quality workout by encouraging and knowledgeable instructors. 

I‚Äôve recently used the outdoor running part. It‚Äôs amazing! You get a solid playlist and someone coaching you through each step. I‚Äôve increased my muscle and have lost fat by consistently using this as my workout (and eating well.). I highly recommend this app and peloton as a brand.",False

The current version drops my heart rate tracking whenever the watch face isn‚Äôt illuminated, and restores it immediately whenever I flick my wrist to activate the watch display.

I decided to give the app a try, understanding that it would BA different experience than on the Peloton bike. 

I was surprised how much I am enjoying it. I am getting workouts equivalent to the rides at the Y where I would walk out drenched in sweat. The instructors are excellent, and I feel motivated.  But what I was not expecting was their other great classes‚Äîstrength, stretching, yoga, running, mediation. So much variety on the app and within each category.

I am not an outdoor cyclist at all but took a spin class with a friend and instantly fell in love with indoor stationery cycling! My first love is outdoor running so I never would have thought to love it so much! The instructors are wonderful! They keep you feeling motivated and carry you through challenging workouts. The workouts are so varied and programs and challenges so helpful! The digital app is awesome for traveling as well. I recently did a treadmill run while traveling and it was fantastic.

82,Better than I expected,,Goawayway,2020-04-07 15:35:05,5,"Like many, I have eyeballed the Peloton bike and cannot possibly justify the cost. I considered downloading the app and subscribing to use alongside my own lower tech spin bike at home, but never got around to it. Now that I am stuck at home during the pandemic, I had absolutely no reason not to give it a try, especially with the 90 day free trial they have going on. 

I am very picky about music when I spin, and I love having the ability to search for classes by music genre and preview the  playlist, in addition to searching by instructor, class length and difficulty level.

I am hooked. I bring the classes up on my smart TV in front of my bike, and do my thing. I have tried several classes now, and most of the instructors are fantastic. (Ally Love is my favorite so far!) Even though I am usually watching a recording of a class, it still feels like they are talking to me. The classes are challenging while also upbeat and encouraging, and I am considering canceling my gym membership and only using this for workouts once the COVID-19 situation is under control.

The app itself is easy to navigate and the features are a slimmed down version of the bike touchscreen. The issues I have are with the interface that allows you to view other riders (or not!) during rides. 

As a bike owner I completely understand why we aren‚Äôt able to see the app users on the leaderboards during rides. If they can‚Äôt sync metrics, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to have them all grouped at the bottom of the leaderboard. But as more people join the Peloton app family on non-Peloton bikes, at least give me the option to see my friends! I‚Äôd like the option to be able to toggle on or off the app riders, even if it‚Äôs a separate group, or just people I follow, etc. 

My friend just got a bike, not a Peloton, and I was so excited to ride with her. It was going to be like hanging out while we social distance. But sadly, I can‚Äôt see her on my screen while we ride. And she, an app user, has no way to filter or search for me (even though she could see me if she scrolls through the thousands of live riders on the app). It seems like a missed opportunity for connection now that so many more people are using the subscription in the app.

However, after doing about 10 o the Encore classes, I have noticed a pattern - some start early, some start late, today I wasn‚Äôt admitted into the class until after it was three minutes in (on a 15 minute class). Chat help says there is no solution.

in addition, the website, using a PC, shows all classes in order for the day. In the app, it only shows the category of classes that you are clicked on and you have click on each type of class to plan your workouts. The top bar ‚Äúslips‚Äù, especially if there are no classes in that category on the day, so that you have to readjust again to check the day.

I was not a runner before, but the coaching of Matty Magiacamo and Becs Gentry, Jess Sims, Robin Arzon, Selena Samuela, Matt Wilpers, Rebecca Kennedy and Andy Speer got me into running shape by June! I started taking the app on my road bike and trying cycling classes which I loved!

167,App need to improve and trainers need more training,,AlfCastillo,2020-02-07 00:54:30,1,"I joined the 30 days trial to check the App out. Here is my experience:

Good:
Music and class energy of many trainers is fantastic. I used my Bose speaker and I could feel the energy

Bad:
The App is not for cyclist trying to find some home training app. The App does. It support power meters and you cannot really setup your training based on power or training zones.

The trainers have good energy and keep the class interesting, but it is impossible to follow the work out. For example, you hear them screaming Go Go Go and I was like go what? 30 seconds sprint at 120? Training zone 3, 4 ? Power at 75% your FTP?? What? For how long? 20 secs? 30 secs? Whaaaat????? What is the goal? 

If you are not a performance oriented cyclist then it is awesome because of the music, but if you have used Apps like Sufferfest for example, you will find this App very uninterested.

My feedback:

change the App GUI to make it easier to follow the workout targets
Include power meter support from Wahoo for example
Train your trainers to comun√≠cate clear goals: sprint for 20 sec! Keep cadence for 3 mins. Reach Zone 3 ! Go to 110% your FTP for 2 mins.... etc etc. Be clear on what is the goal because when you are pushing hard your mind starts going places and it helps when the trainer keeps you focus.

I have a few ideas for a future update though.

- for the yoga flow videos (or maybe others) if I could get a list of what the instructor is doing to help me keep my spot with them; it could even check things off as the instructor moves through them. During folds or turns, I get lost no matter where I put the screen and wind up either still down when they‚Äôre up or still folded when the instructor has moved on and not sure what I‚Äôve missed.
- a 15 or 30 second rewind and fast forward; sometimes I miss something but find it really difficult to find out what exactly it was using the scrubber as it often moves too quickly and then I get lost
- not moving the camera so much with the yoga classes; I often get turned around with what side the instructor is on when they are not very explicit with instructions OR having one small camera in the corner where it just shows the instructor from the front or back.",False

I‚Äôve been a member for 10+ months and lately the Apple Watch keeps losing connection for heart rate onscreen even though when I look at the watch it has the heart rate. 

I cannot help but think the incorrect calorie calculations is a results of the heart rate connection issue. Seems like the app is not consistent as of the last month or so, and I sincerely hope it‚Äôs not sell their own peloton wearables.

The only improvements might be to:

1. provide training plans.
2. It looks like Peloton strongly encourage everyone to be giddy with excitement, abnormally positive. Sure, the trainers should smile a lot. But it‚Äôs ok not to abnormally smile 100% of the time. It‚Äôs ok to show intensity, or to get serious for a 3 minute lactate-producing effort. I think it was St Augustine who taught that you have zero emotion, or both sides of the coin.",False
