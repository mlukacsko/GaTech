(2) All the requirements, per the corresponding dataset, are contained in each .py file.
(3) Each .py file is to be ran on its own, corresponding to the dataset being used. 

Instructions to run:
(1) Copy the wine_origin.py, breast_cancer.py and the Dataset folder from Box using the GA Tech Box shared link:
