Prior to running the code, the following packages and versions will be needed along with Python 3.8 and an IDE of choice.
(1) numpy == 1.23.1
(2) pandas == 1.4.3
(3) matplotlib == 3.6.3
(4) scikit-learn == 1.2.0
(5) mlrose-hive==2.2.4

Note:
(1)  Assignment 2 – Part 1: Each optimization problem is implemented independently and contains the four local random search algorithms.   
(2) Assignment 2 – Part 2: Neural network optimization implemented independently and contains the three local random search algorithms used to optimize the neural network, as well as a neural network using backpropagation for optimization
(3) Each .py file is to be ran on its own, corresponding to the optimization problem being solved. 

Instructions to run:
(1) Copy all the .py files and the dataset folder from Box using the GA Tech Box shared link: https://gatech.box.com/s/g1senbstz9g8rxgrsvbgyxz6m6osxjpz
(2) Run fourPeaks.py, continuosPeaks.py, and/or flipFlop.py corresponding to Assignment 2 – Part 1.  
(3) Run nn_optimization.py corresponding to Assignment 2 – Part 2.
