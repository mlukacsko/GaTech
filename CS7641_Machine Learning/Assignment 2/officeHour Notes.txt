assignment 2

mlrose library --> hiive fork - use this.  

find existing optimazation problems, dont need to create new
k coloring (choose nuber of nodes to color), 4 peaks, flip flop, traveling salesman (choose number of cities)

highlight one of three for each of the algorithms - vauge, left up to you....

PLOTS
fitness score x axis per iteration y axis
how big should the problem space be? different algs highlights for different problem sizes.  tradeoff of problem size per algorithm
wall clock time
function evaluations per iteration (times as well) 




second section - NN section.  NN from assignment 1.  this is using the datset
comapre backprop to randomized optimized algs

mlrose to sckitit learn have differences, can use new parameters...apple to apples is hard in some cases

PLOTS
learning curve
validation curve
loss curve - convergance
compare confusion matricies, etc...more open ended approach
wall clock times
