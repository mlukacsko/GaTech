Prior to running the code, the following packages and versions will be needed along with Python 3.8 and an IDE of choice.
(1) numpy == 1.23.1
(2) pandas == 1.4.3
(3) matplotlib == 3.6.3
(4) scikit-learn == 1.2.0

Note:
Each classifier is implemented twice, once using each of the two datasets.
Each wine_<classifier>.py or breastCancer_<classifier>.py file is to be ran independently corresponding to the classifier and dataset.


Instructions to run:
(1) Copy all the .py files and the dataset folder from Box using the shared link: https://gatech.box.com/s/kf0cxz8xmbx5in9qshx9dhpg5dhwozee
(2) Run any wine_<classifier>.py or breastCancer_<classifier>.py file to test classifiers.
(2) Run <dataset>_TimeAndAccuracy.py to produce time and accuracy for the corresponding dataset
